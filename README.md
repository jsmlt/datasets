JSMLT Datasets Repository
=====
The JSMLT datasets repository contains several small sample datasets that can be loaded directly in [JSMLT](https://github.com/jsmlt).

This repository is likely to be moved to an external location in due time. The JSMLT Datasets API will be updated when this is the case. As such, this repository should generally only be used for accessing datasets with JSMLT.
